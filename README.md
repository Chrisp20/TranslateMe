# TranslateMe
The final solo project, translateMe app
# Project 6 -TranslateMe App

Submitted by: Christopher Petit

TranslateMe is an app that allows users to translate words. Using the MyMemory's REST API to build a translator! The translation is more functional, we're going to store those results in a database using Firebase!

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Users open the app to a TranslationMe home page with a place to enter a word, phrase or sentence, a button to translate, and another field that should initially be empty
- [X] When users tap translate, the word written in the upper field translates in the lower field. The requirement is only that you can translate from one language to another.
- [X] A history of translations can be stored (in a scroll view in the same screen, or a new screen)
- [X] The history of translations can be erased
 
The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a variety of choices for the languages
- [ ] Add UI flair

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- [X] Implement some of the stretch optional features

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- It was challenging to get my clear all transactions to work as it was not deleting any of the words before.
