Group 11 App Ideas

**App Idea 1: Healthy Life**

What: Healthy Life is an app where users can help keep track of their health by calculating their Body Mass Index, set daily calorie goals for each day of the week and update the calories consumed throughout the day, and plan workouts by specifying the type of workout, duration, time of day, etc.

Who: Healthy Life is for people who are looking to improve their health and people who want to monitor their daily habits that affect their health, such as calories consumed and workouts.

Why: This app makes it easier for people to live healthier lives if they have some information that shows what they do throughout the day that negatively or positively affects their health and they can modify this information based on their needs and what they want to accomplish.

Challenges: Some challenges could include accurately indentifying the body mass index of the user due to the differing heights and weights and determining whether the user met their calorie goals for a day.



**App Idea 2: MovieFind**

What: MovieFind is an app where users can find information about movies such as release date, cast, director, description, ratings, and theaters or streaming services where it is available to see. Users could search for the movie they want to see information for.

Who: MovieFind is for people that are interested in seeing information about specific movies, such as the ratings if the user wants to see other users' opinions about the movie or the streaming service where it currently is available to watch.

Why: People often want to see information about a movie before they watch it so that they could make an informed decision about whether they want to see it or not. Movie fans might want an easily available app where they could look up something from a movie that interested them, such as the year that the movie came out or the name of the actor that played the main character, etc.

Challenges: The main challenge is finding a suitable API to get information about movies and determining how the call to an API can include the searched movie that the user entered.
